# APEP Styles

This document is reserved for future style customization features.

## Current Style

APEP currently uses a fixed Rust-inspired style:
- Severity prefix (\rror\, \warning\, \
ote\)
- Error codes in brackets (\[E001]\)
- Location with arrow (\->\)
- Source context with line numbers
- Caret/span highlighting

## Future Customization

Planned features:
- Custom color schemes
- Alternative layout styles
- Compact vs verbose modes
- JSON/structured output

See [IMPROVEMENTS.md](../IMPROVEMENTS.md) for details.
